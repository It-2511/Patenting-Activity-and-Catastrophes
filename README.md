Information on the code: Runs wells with leaving sections "# Check for faulty and missing values etc." and 
"# Visualisation of Catastrophe impact (More precisely: LogPropertyDmgPerCapita(ADJ 2022) and LogPropertyDmg(ADJ 2022))"  and "# Trial visualisation of patenting activity and catastrophes FIPS 01001" out- parts of this are not up to date, so they might not work in general.
Everything else is necessary for it to run properly.
